<h1>Header at *Level* 1</h1><br/><p>Headers appear on a line of their own. A header starts with the one or more occurrences of the symbol `#` followed by one space followed by text and ends with a newline. </p>
<h4>This is a header at level 2 </h4><br/><h1>Paragraphs</h1><br/><p>Paragraphs are free form <strong><em>text</em></strong>. Paragraphs <strong>are</strong> separated by new lines. So here is some <strong>bold</strong> text and some <em>italicized</em> text.</p>
<br/><p>This is the second paragraph in this section</p>
<br/><p>You can see an example <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/wi9yHmX7Sztuw/giphy.gif">Confused</a>, and it can followed other words. </p>

</ul>
<ol>

</ol>
<ul>

</ul>
<br/><p>We end an ordered list with an empty line.We can nest ordered lists by adding 2 spaces followed by the same special character for numbered lists, e.g., </p>
<br/><ol>
<li>This is the first item of the outer list </li>
<li>This is the second item of the outer list <ul>
<li>This is the first item of the inner list </li>
<li>This is the second item of the inner list </li>
